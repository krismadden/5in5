/**
 * <p>This Processing HTTP library makes it easy to communicate with servers on 
 * the Internet using the HTTP protocol- the same communications protocol used 
 * by web browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome to surf 
 * the web.</p>
 * <p>In addition to serving web pages, HTTP is also used to provide 
 * direct access to data from a service provider through what is commonly 
 * called a "web services" API.</p>
 * <p>To get started, refer to the HttpClient documentation.</p>
